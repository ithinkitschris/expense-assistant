# ExpenseTracker Project Checkpoint - December 19, 2024

## Project Overview
The ExpenseTracker is a React Native mobile application with a Python FastAPI backend for expense and grocery management. The app features a modern iOS-style interface with glass morphism design elements.

## Current Architecture

### Frontend (React Native)
- **Location**: `ExpenseTracker/` directory
- **Main App**: `App.js` - Single file containing all components and logic
- **Styling**: `styles.js` - Comprehensive StyleSheet with theme-based styling
- **Themes**: `themes.js` - Light/dark theme definitions
- **Components**: Organized in `components/` directory with extracted components
- **Services**: `services/api.js` - API communication layer

### Backend (Python FastAPI)
- **Location**: `api/` directory
- **Main**: `main.py` - FastAPI application entry point
- **Routes**: Organized in `routes/` directory
  - `expenses.py` - Expense management endpoints
  - `pantry.py` - Pantry/grocery management endpoints
  - `summary.py` - Summary and analytics endpoints
- **Models**: `models/schemas.py` - Pydantic schemas
- **Utils**: `utils/` directory with parsing and categorization utilities

## Key Features Implemented

### Expense Management
- Add, edit, delete expenses
- Category-based organization
- Date-based filtering and grouping
- Amount tracking and formatting
- Search and filtering capabilities

### Grocery/Pantry Management
- Pantry item tracking with quantities
- Grocery list creation and management
- Category-based organization
- Consumption tracking
- Item editing and deletion

### UI/UX Features
- Modern glass morphism design
- Dark/light theme support
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive layout
- iOS-style components and interactions

### Data Visualization
- Calendar view with expense indicators
- Category-based expense summaries
- Monthly spending overview
- Trend analysis and insights

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native, Expo
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Styling**: React Native StyleSheet with custom theme system
- **State Management**: React hooks and local state
- **API Communication**: Fetch API with custom service layer

## Recent Development Focus
- Component extraction and modularization
- Style consolidation and theme system improvements
- API endpoint organization and optimization
- UI/UX enhancements with modern design patterns
- Database schema improvements and data consistency

## Next Development Priorities
1. Complete component extraction from App.js
2. Implement comprehensive error handling
3. Add offline support and data synchronization
4. Enhance analytics and reporting features
5. Optimize performance and reduce bundle size

## Database Schema
- **expenses**: Core expense data with categories, amounts, dates
- **pantry_items**: Grocery/pantry items with quantities and categories
- **categories**: Expense and grocery categories with metadata

## API Endpoints
- **GET /expenses**: Retrieve expenses with filtering
- **POST /expenses**: Create new expense
- **PUT /expenses/{id}**: Update expense
- **DELETE /expenses/{id}**: Delete expense
- **GET /pantry**: Retrieve pantry items
- **POST /pantry**: Add pantry item
- **PUT /pantry/{id}**: Update pantry item
- **DELETE /pantry/{id}**: Delete pantry item
- **GET /summary**: Get expense summaries and analytics

## Configuration
- Theme system with automatic light/dark mode detection
- Category icons and colors
- API base URL configuration
- Database connection settings

This checkpoint represents a stable, feature-complete expense tracking application with modern UI/UX design and a robust backend API.
